            in class there isn't really much to say since we were on
            spring break so there was no class. I did try to work on the upcoming assignment over break.

                For this second part I'll be doing a continuation of where I left off last time. Last time I got into
                the mystery of the
                orbit of objects around galaxies since by our current understanding of physics doesn't make sense. The
                objects orbiting
                the Sun in the solar system are ridiculously less massive than the sun itself so the sun dominates over
                the
                gravitational influence of the solar system and thus causes objects to orbits around it. However this
                isn't the case
                when it comes to galaxies. Everything in the galaxy orbits a super massive black hole at the center and
                yet that very
                black hole is less massive than all of the mass combined that's orbiting it. The supermassive black hole
                does not
                dominate the gravitational influence of the Galaxy and therefore shouldn't be able to force its objects
                to orbit it. The
                theory that I have come up with revolves around something that isn't really well known when it comes to
                astronomy in the
                general population called quasi Stars. Of course I star is a theoretical star that doesn't exist to our
                knowledge today,
                it is described as a star that has formed in the early universe when everything was a lot more densely
                packed and
                normally when a star gathers enough Mass to kickstart its Fusion at the core it blows away all other
                mass that it could
                possibly gather, but since the early Universe was a lot more dense this Mass was not blown away but
                instead gathered
                more creating a star on a scale that we can't comprehend, it's core so massive that in formation it
                collapses into a
                black hole and when it does the outward radiation pressure of that black hole creates a balance with the
                immense gravity
                of the star and the black hole ends up slowly eating the star from the inside out. To my knowledge this
                is actually a
                theory explaining why supermassive black holes exist since our universe is not old enough to produce
                black holes of that
                size through the means that we know today. I think cuz I stars did more than just create supermassive
                black holes
                though, I think when quasi Stars were eaten into super massive black holes I think the outward radiation
                pressure blew
                away some of the mass that was a part of the star. When the star reached the end of its life and shed
                its outer layers
                all the leftover Mass could have laid the groundwork to eventually form galaxies. I think this may be
                the case since by
                our current understanding of physics it's a massive black holes shouldn't be able to become as massive
                as they are. On
                top of that it would explain why the majority of objects orbiting the Galaxy orbit on a plane in the
                same direction.
                This is due to conservation of angular momentum which to put simply is that unless an outside force is
                act upon it a
                spinning object tends to keep spinning, so in other words a spinning star what still keep spinning as a
                black hole as
                well as pulling it's ejected materials to that spin.
