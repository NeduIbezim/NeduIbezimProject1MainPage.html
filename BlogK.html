        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> During the duration of this course, I've learned a lot
            about HTML and CSS web development. I enjoyed learning a lot of
            the aspects of it and what I enjoyed most of all is being able to put what I've learned to the test and get
            immediate
            feedback via the results that I receive. That's one thing I really liked about this class and really about
            computer
            coding in general. Thanks to this class I am able to go more in-depth when it comes to web development,
            before this I
            really only knew how to do basic stuff in HTML and nothing else. Working through this project I ran into a
            lot of Errors
            regarding website publication and animation of different elements on my page but I found my way around it
            each time
            what's funny is that I've noticed a pattern. Whenever I run into an issue that I just can't pass or solve
            the moment I
            go and ask for help and then work on that same problem if I wasn't able to solve it with the assistance I
            got I would
            always find some way to then fix the problem and it baffles me to this day. When it came to the class itself
            I really
            enjoyed the atmosphere that it set, it gave a laid-back feeling well also a productivity feeling, I'm not
            sure how to
            describe it, it's as if you are having a really productive day writing a paper in a coffee shop. In my
            honest opinion
            looking back at week one versus now I never really would have thought I would have gotten this far by this
            time.

            Now for a final rant about space because I'm not sure what else to talk about. I recently went to the last
            meeting of
            the Astro Society for the Year on campus. It was really fun as we just stood around, ate pizza, and hung out
            with a
            service dog someone brought. I have at one point got into a conversation with two or three people on
            different space
            subjects and in my opinion that was exponentially fun. We jumped around a bit talking about the upcoming
            solar eclipse
            that's going to come over Ohio in 2024 to talking about exoplanets and super-Earths. We also talked about an
            interesting
            subject, how the solar system that we live in right now is a bit abnormal compared to the rest of the solar
            systems out
            that we observe. What I learned is that while I knew Jupiter has an effect on the solar system like how it
            redirects
            asteroids from hitting the Earth what I didn't know is how pivotal the mere presence of Jupiter was that
            changed our
            entire solar system. When gas giants like Jupiter first emerged in early solar systems they typically formed
            close to
            their host star and then migrate outwards this was likely the case with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
            Neptune. But
            Jupiter is thought to be responsible for many more things such as causing two terrestrial planets to smash
            into each
            other thus creating the Earth and the Moon, disrupting the gravitational influence of the debris and the
            asteroid belts
            resulting in the absence of any planetary formation and the reduction of planetary Mass available to Mars
            during its
            early stages of formation resulting in the smaller planet that we see today.
