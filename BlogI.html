            of the time I've been working on the final project for the
            end of the semester. I hope to include all my ideas within the final project. I did spend some time on
            monday to celebrate my birthday.

                Now for another rambling session about astronomy.One thing I find interesting when it comes to astronomy
                and all of that
                stuff is the very existence of light itself. It's so interesting that a particle can exist that has no
                defined Mass yet
                can interact with other matter. Travels at C(the speed of light) the very moment it's created and yet
                it's affected by
                gravity, for example when a extremely massive object exists in space light tends to bend around that
                object and of
                course the most notable being that once light enters a black hole it cannot Escape due to its
                unfathomably intense
                gravitational pull. Other thing that I really like about it is how we can use light in order to tell how
                old something
                is in space. There are examples such as the sun being eight light minutes away so every time we look at
                the sun we're
                actually seeing what it looked like 8 minutes ago but one thing I really find intriguing is the cosmic
                microwave
                background. It's a remnant of microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang. If I'm correct then
                what's really
                interesting about this is that hypothetically if you could travel at the speed of light following those
                photons from the
                cosmic microwave background you could hypothetically go back in time to the early Universe when
                everything was a lot
                more compact.

                Geomagnetic fields and sunstorms are fascinating phenomena that have captured the attention of
                scientists and the
                general public for many years. Geomagnetic fields are magnetic fields that surround the Earth, and they
                are created by
                the movement of molten iron in the Earth's core. These fields are essential for protecting the Earth
                from the solar wind
                and other harmful particles that come from space. On the other hand, sunstorms are intense bursts of
                energy that
                originate from the sun and can have a significant impact on the Earth's geomagnetic field. When a
                sunstorm occurs, a
                massive amount of energy is released from the sun's atmosphere, creating a surge of charged particles
                that travel
                towards Earth. These particles can cause disruptions, such as geomagnetic storms and auroras. The most
                severe sunstorms
                are known as coronal mass ejections, which are massive eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields that can
                release billions
                of tons of material into space at high speeds. When a coronal mass ejection hits the Earth's magnetic
                field, it can
                cause a geomagnetic storm that can last for hours or even days. By studying the relationship between
                geomagnetic fields
                and sunstorms, scientists can better understand these phenomena and their potential impacts on Earth's
                communication
                systems, power grids, and other critical infrastructure. This research is crucial for predicting when
                sunstorms are
                likely to occur and mitigating their effects.
