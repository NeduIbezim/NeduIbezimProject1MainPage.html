            more of a general
            display of the materials that would lead to the different web
            pages with their own unique little backdrops and moving Parts in the background. Although I wanted to take a
            different
            approach when it came to the main page where you would be able to go into those different sections. I want
            to make it
            based on a menu that you would see in a video game as it's happily showing you the options that you can
            choose from and
            reacting generously to each option that you hover over or choose. I initially wanted to include more
            animation in the
            webpages and 2D Arts tabs and maybe add more tabs but i had to cut corners for the sake of time
