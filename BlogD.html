        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> So thinking over what we went through during the week one thing that comes to my mind is that we recently began working on our first project. Initially, I was very excited about working on this project as I've never actually created my own website before outside of using a program like Wix, and I never have made a portfolio website of my own despite having artwork across different mediums. I know I had my initial thoughts on the design for my web page for the project however I'm considering changing it because I don't feel confident with the design that I've come up with so far. I am considering adding in more detailed effects like a small Melody that plays when you hover your mouse over a tab or a specific animation that plays when you click on anything or an artwork. One thing I really want to incorporate with my portfolio web page is some interesting animation like the tabs breaking apart as the camera Zooms into one of the shards revealing the next page.

For some context when a planet or Celestial body is tidally locked to another the rotation of the orbiting planet begins to match the rate of rotation of the object it's orbiting, as a result, one side of the planet is always facing the object that it's orbiting. For example, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth meaning we only see one side of the moon no matter where we are on Earth. Now hearing that definition it seems simple enough to understand, although what I don't understand about that cool phenomenon is the fact that the closer an object is to what it's orbiting the more and more likely it is to be tidally locked to a point where it's certain and that's what I don't understand, the fact that there is a point where the chance of a planet of being tidally locked is a certainty. That is undoubtedly cool but also a little terrifying.

            My only guess as to why this phenomenon happens is due to the fact that gravity is relative, since gravity becomes stronger The Closer You Are and weaker the farther you are the relative amount of gravity that's enacted on the closest part of the planet versus the farther side of the planet is varied to such a degree that it causes it to slowly but surely tidally locked to the object it's orbiting. I think the minimum amount of distance you have to be for a planet to tidally walk to what it's orbiting varies on a few variables like the size of the object and overall Mass. After all, the gargantuan mass that is the sun takes up 99.98% of all available mass in the solar system, and despite that Mercury, the closest planet to the sun is not tidally locked to the Sun.
