        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> So thinking over what we went through during the week one
            thing that comes to my mind is that we recently began working on our first project. Initially, I was very
            excited about working on this project as I've never actually created my own website before outside of using
            a program like Wix, and I never have made a portfolio website of my own despite having artwork across
            different mediums. I know I had my initial thoughts on the design for my web page for the project however
            I'm considering changing it because I don't feel confident with the design that I've come up with so far. I
            am considering adding in more detailed effects like a small Melody that plays when you hover your mouse over
            a tab or a specific animation that plays when you click on anything or an artwork. One thing I really want
            to incorporate with my portfolio web page is some interesting animation like the tabs breaking apart as the
            camera Zooms into one of the shards revealing the next page.

                Now for another ramble, one thing that I'd like to look into later that I don't really get when it comes
                to space is the concept of a planet or body being tidally locked to a much larger body. For some context
                when a planet or Celestial body is tidally locked to another the rotation of the orbiting planet begins
                to match the rate of rotation of the object it's orbiting, as a result, one side of the planet is always
                facing the object that it's orbiting. For example, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth meaning we
                only see one side of the moon no matter where we are on Earth. Now hearing that definition it seems
                simple enough to understand, although what I don't understand about that cool phenomenon is the fact
                that the closer an object is to what it's orbiting the more and more likely it is to be tidally locked
                to a point where it's certain and that's what I don't understand, the fact that there is a point where
                the chance of a planet of being tidally locked is a certainty. That is undoubtedly cool but also a
                little terrifying.

                My only guess as to why this phenomenon happens is due to the fact that gravity is relative, since
                gravity becomes stronger The Closer You Are and weaker the farther you are the relative amount of
                gravity that's enacted on the closest part of the planet versus the farther side of the planet is varied
                to such a degree that it causes it to slowly but surely tidally locked to the object it's orbiting. I
                think the minimum amount of distance you have to be for a planet to tidally walk to what it's orbiting
                varies on a few variables like the size of the object and overall Mass. After all, the gargantuan mass
                that is the sun takes up 99.98% of all available mass in the solar system, and despite that Mercury, the
                closest planet to the sun is not tidally locked to the Sun.
