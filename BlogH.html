        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> Looking at the past week I enjoyed doing the exercise that
            we worked on and presented on Monday. What I really liked
            about that exercise is the fact that I came to an interesting result from an error. Something I find really
            cool in a
            way, is how a lot of great things could sometimes come from complete errors or mistakes. For example, a
            commonly known
            thing in the Gaming Community is that the notorious Creeper from Minecraft started out as a simple computer
            bug, it was
            originally supposed to be a pig. Another more historical instance is the creation of the first antibiotic
            penicillin and
            how its creation came from a scientist carelessly leaving their petri dish out as they went on vacation.
            Another thing
            that I would like to touch on was the presentation given on Friday. I was really engaged and at one point
            wanted to
            throw my own comments into the ring however someone already beat me to it.

                Now for another Astro rant as I guess I should call it. I came across a comment recently about time
                travel and how it
                really wouldn't work if you were to do it in our world now considering the constant implications. I
                guess I should start
                off by saying I have heard that is theorized that even if you could travel back through time there is a
                chance that
                since matter cannot be created or destroyed your body would be made out of antimatter which wouldn't
                affect you too much
                however if you were to encounter yourself and touch yourself you would end up destroying each other from
                the
                interaction, the interesting thing is that the farther you go back the more likely you're going to
                encounter more and
                more particles that's a part of you since you're made up of different particles that came from all over
                the planet. I
                guess I should start off by saying at least from my knowledge it is almost impossible to travel backward
                in time or at
                least there's no known way to, however, there is theoretically a way to travel forward in time. In order
                to travel
                forward in time theoretically you would have to travel at near-light speed as you travel closer and
                closer to the speed
                of light you begin to age slower than the space around you thus you are able to travel forward in time.
                One thing that
                occurred to me from somebody's comments is that even if you do travel forward in time or backward in
                time you have to
                take into account that you have to move with what you are moving through time with, meaning that if you
                were to in that
                very same spot move through time while you'd think that you may end up at a random spot on the planet
                the reality is you
                won't even see our world in fact you might not even see the sun you'd be just floating in empty space.
                This is because
                while the Earth is rotating while orbiting the Sun, the Sun is orbiting the galactic center at a speed
                of 483,000 mph
                and if that isn't insane enough the Galaxy is moving at 1.3 million miles per hour, granted that isn't
                enough to exit
                the Milky Way since the Milky Way spans for 600 trillion miles.
